Jacob Hollingsworth was born in 1742 in Birmingham, Pennsylvania, to Barbara Shewin, age 36, and Samuel Harlan "Yeoman" Hollingsworth, age 35.

He married Mary Brooks on March 17, 1768, in Center, Chester County, Pennsylvania. They were Quakers. They had seven children in 19 years.

After the arrival in northeast Georgia of Jacob Hollingsworth, Sr. in 1792 from Burke Co., NC, an outpost named “Fort Hollingsworth” was built in 1793 by Hollingsworth on newly opened lands resulting from treaties with the Cherokee Nation and was meant to protect the settlers in the area (near Alto, Georgia).[1]

“Fort Hollingsworth” still stands today but with only one-acre of land around the old fort. Jacob Sr. left the fort & the land (which was then many acres) to his heirs in his will of 1822.[2]
“Fort Hollingsworth” is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. On the paperwork for the registry application, there are no burials noted on the one-acre of land, just the buildings. The address is 2307 Wynn Lake Rd., Hollingsworth, Banks Co., GA. (The original Franklin County was divided into several counties including Banks County.) [3]

He died in 1822 in Franklin, Georgia, having lived a long life of 79 years. Find A Grave: Memorial #166451019
