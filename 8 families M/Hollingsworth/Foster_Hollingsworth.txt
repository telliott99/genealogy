would be my mom's cousin.  It's not clear who made the application to "National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania" since it's dated 1988 and her death is given as 1974.

In any case, Virginia Mims Bogan (Gilmore) claims to be 10th in descent from Valentine Hollingsworth, and provides references to prove it.

In particular, Mary Amelia Hollingsworth is shown as the 5th generation and Jacob Hollingsworth as the 6th (counting backword).  The application says there is an inscription on the tombstone of Mary, also the 1850 census lists them living with Sarah, Jacob's wife.
