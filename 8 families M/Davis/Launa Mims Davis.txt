Stone says Mims Davis Foster.
NE says death date Sep 23.  This date is from the gravestone.
Death notice says f RL Davis, m Frances Mims.

The 1920 census gives her and a sister plus Francese and Lucile.
But also two men Lewis D. (41) and Kirby C. (39) are shown as sons.
They are probably her sister's kids, but not listed on the marker.
