James Martin Foster (1831-1900)
Mary Eleanor Long Foster (1842-1910)

married in 1859 when Eleanor was "almost seventeen" [1]

Nellie Long Foster's father was William Long.

They lived on the plantation until 1870, then moved to Shreveport to a home they called Curraghmuir [1]

mother of eleven children, seven of whom ?? and five survive her [1]

Her son Claiborne Foster graduated from West Point Military Academy in 1888 and died in 1890, and her son John Gray Foster died soon after his father.  The son William Long Foster has been a prominent cotton planter of Caddo Parish, and the other son is James M., Jr.  The daughter Lucille married Benton McMillin .. [1]

I believe 5 were born on the plantation and 6 in Shreveport.  Their memorials have only 8.  The missing 3 are from before 1870.  I know two.

William Long obit mentions 

Mary Elinor Foster = Mrs. Comegys of New York City
Theresa Olive Foster = Mrs. Felix McWillie Williams "of this parish"

I can match all of those as sisters.

Luella D. Foster = Mrs. C.C. Crenshaw of Hillsborough, TX and Lubbock
Frances Foster = E.L. Goodbar, Rainsberger ?
Eleanor Minor Foster = W.M. Meriweather
Lucille Foster = Mrs. Harney Bogan

Mary Elinor was born on the plantation and the other two in town, plus two who died young and the oldest of the in-town kids:
