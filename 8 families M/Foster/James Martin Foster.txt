Capt. James Martin Foster is probably the best documented of the g5 generation.

I have two screenshots of info about him written as if he's alive.
Not sure where it came from anymore.

Born near Monroeville, AL in 1831.
Came with parents to Caddo Parish, LA in 1842.
Attended Western Military Institute in Drennon Springs, KY
(Civil engineering, 1853)

Two brothers Claiborne J. and Jacob Flavel.

"collector of tax-in-kind .. district embracing the parishes of Caddo and De Soto.
planter
from 1888 on the "police jury" for Caddo parish.

Sheltered the wounded in his house after the Battle of Mansfield.

I found a mention in a report about one of the big battles of the Red River Campaign, at Mansfield and Pleasant Hill.

http://www.countygenweb.com/desotoparishla/civreac.htm

"Confederate soldiers and others traveling between Mansfield and Pleasant Hill the next day commented about the aftereffects of the running fight between the two towns.  H. C. Medford estimated that dead men and horses were scattered over an area of at least nine square miles--J. M. Foster thought that he could have walked on dead federals for a full five miles.  "

Obit for him part of FindaGrave:

"His plantation on the border line of Louisiana and Texas, was called the 'New Egypt'".  Literal?  Found two others named the same, but not the right one.

o Eleanor (Mary Ellen) "Nettie" Long (1842-1910)

Fell from his horse, a year ago, less buoyant but still active.
farm near Keachie, Desoto parish in 1848

Caddo parish is a large parish including Shreveport and west of there, both north and south of the city.

Kingston and Mansfield (battles) both due south of Shreveport.
Keachi about 10 mi west of Kingston.
So not on the river itself.
Maybe 5 mi from TX border.

Keachi (Keatchi), Kingston et al in De Soto parish.  Parish seat is Mansfield.

More about the graves in the write-up for Flavel Foster.

f Flavel died 1860
m Mary Hollingsworth Foster died 1864

Moved to Caddo Parish about 1870, so moved from Keachi after the war.

JM's grandparents aree supposed to be buried at the cemetery in Keatchie.  His mother Mary also died there but is at Preston.  Both said to be "Hollingsworth Cemetery".  Preston not a place really, but just north of Keachi.  Google doesn't know a cemetery of that name nearby, there is one 40 mi east of Jackson.
