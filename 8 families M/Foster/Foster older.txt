Flavel's mother was Elizabeth Foster

https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/64608572/elizabeth-foster

b Sep 15 1777
d Nov 2 1835
died at Monroe Co., AL

b at Foster Cemetery
Monroeton, Monroe Co., AL

also buried there is her son
Richardson Foster 1800-1835

The Fosters were on the move from Georgia, and lived in Monroe Co., AL for a while.  Flavel was born in Georgia according to FindaGrave, and moved on to Louisiana after the death of his father, his mother Elizabeth, and brother Richardson in 1835.  He was 34 that year.

Monroeville is ca 75 mi NE of mobile, toward Montgomery.

I have dates:

Richardson d Mar 18 1835
William C. d Aug 30 1835
Elizabeth  d Nov 02 1835

One source is FindaGrave
https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/64608572/elizabeth-foster#

What evidence they have I don't really know.  I have seen reporting from people who found the graves in a cemetery outside Monroeville, Monroe Co., AL.  (Richardson and Elizabeth but not William C.).  It seems they all died within a few months in 1835.

In particular 
https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/135039045/richardson-foster
gives the date for Richardson Foster.

The dates for the other two are from the markers.

What source for the birth dates?

It seems likely that he is also in the cemetery at Monroeville but the grave is lost.

somewhere I got the info that
Richardson (Flavel's brother) and he married sisters
Flavel o Mary Hollingsworth

Richardson o Amanda Hollingsworth

Elizabeth Adeline Foster b. 1831
Thomas Foster b. 1834
Richardson Foster b. 1836
both boys died early

I pasted it into Richardson Foster's page
someone replies that they know the graves in east of Monroeville, AL

One big source is Elizabeth's will.

see screenshots
Elizabeth Foster Will 1 & 2

Reference is Monroe Co., AL Deeds and Wills, Book A, p. 111.

Her executor is William C. Foster, that's her son, not her husband, since he supposedly died in August.

She gives Richardson 3 Negroes.  There's more than one problem, since he's dead by then.

will has
son Richardson Foster, deceased w/ 3 children
son Flavel Foster
daughter Julia B. Manning
son Wm C. Foster.
son John W.
son Frederick Colbert

"The reason I do not provide for him [Frederick Colbert] more liberally is that he has never paid me that attention I consider to be due from a son to a mother."

Name provides circumstantial evidence that her maiden name was Colbert.  Many other Fosters mentioned nearby in the same book.

----

According to note on Elizabeth Colbert FindaGrave
her father William Colbert 1725-1797
has a will!
And will gives Elizabeth's husband as 
William Claiborne Foster < 1780 - Aug 30 1835

Be nice to have that.
But I'd be surprised if he's really in  there.  Not old enough.

There's a famous Chickasaw named William Colbert b 1742-1750 d May 30 1824, but that's a different guy.

FindaGrave has death in 1860.

1850 census is said to have him born in GA, but son Claiborne says he's born in VA.

Ancestry shows an inquiry about Elizabeth Foster, so they probably have more.

Amanda (Richardson's wife) remarried.  

I know that later Amanda moved to Caddo Parish with her second husband.  She's buried near Keatchie.

gives Elizabeth's parents
William Colbert b 1725 Hancock GA
Miriam Geer b 1748 NC

from will 1797 of William Colbert

I saw somewhere that graves have been lost in that cemetery so William Claiborne may once have been there.

William Colbert 

b. 1725 Norfolk, VA

Besides Elizabeth there is another son
William Colbert

actually 10 children altogether

according to FamilySearch 
William Colbert is in the 
1820 census at Elbert, Georgia
1830 census oat Monroe, Walton Co., Georgia

still don't have a handle on
William Claiborne Foster (<1780-Aug 30 1835)

The first Claiborne in America was
Col. William Claiborne (1600-1677)
http://oursoutherncousins.com/claiborne.html

so 150 years later there were a lot of them including
William C.C. Claiborne, Governor of Louisiana

Another:

The real key to tie things together is the cemetery in Monroeville, AL where Elizabeth and Flavel's brother Richardson are buried and also Elizabeth Foster's will (see file for her).  It's clear that Elizabeth is the mother of Flavel and Richardson and her husband was William Claiborne Foster.

I'm not sure where I got a date of death for WC but I have

Richardson d Mar 18 1835
William C. d Aug 30 1835
Elizabeth  d Nov 02 1835

Seems to have been a rough year.

If that's right f William Claiborne probably should be in the cemetery at Monroeville since I believe they lived there for a while.  One source said some graves "disappeared."

[1] below gives an alternative history and calls this story "unproven source" but I think it's pretty certain given the markers and the will that this is correct.

Richardson married Amanda Melvina Hollingsworth b May 23 1812 in Franklin Co., GA and (she) died May 02 1862 at Shreveprot.  o Richardson Feb 10 1830, Richardson b Mar 31 1800 in VA, buried in Monroe Co. AL.

more Hollingsworths. Frances and husband William Crosby are buried at Mansfield 1860, 1884.  He remarried 1867.

The Keatchi property is sometimes said to be in Caddo Parish and sometimes in DeSoto.

printed as:  FOSTER CEMETERY.pdf

"There, the families settled in Keatchie, Desoto Parish, Louisiana. Later, they established Forest Home Plantation at Four Forks, Caddo Parish, Louisiana The modern location is west of La. 169 at the end of Firetower Rd."

La. 169 runs NS about 2 mi from Texas border.
"Four Forks" is NW of Keatchie on La. 169.  Just N of there is Firetower Rd.

There is a cemetery.
According to FindaGrave
https://www.findagrave.com/cemetery/67574/fullalove-cemetery

The Fullalove Cemetery in southwest Caddo Parish holds the remains of members of the Fullilove Family, who owned nearby Forest Home Plantation, now long gone. The misspelling in the name is historic and apparently intentional. The cemetery is on private land and is maintained by a neighbor, a Shreveport police detective.

----

When James Martin moved to Shreveport in 1870 he may have sold out?, but some graves are from e.g. 1852, 1861.

Forest Home Plantation is listed
http://genealogytrails.com/lou/plantatons.html

but no info at that link.  (There are other plantations of the same name).

search for "Forest Home Plantation" AND Foster gives:
https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/217408876.pdf

said to mention "J.F. Foster of ... to engage V.I. Brown as manager of Forest Home"
but p. 208 has Forest Home and Brown but not Foster and indicates it's down near Iberville.

Overview of sugar plantations (they had transitioned from cotton in the 1840s).

Here's a post that's mostly about the Hollingsworths, but has detail on Flavel and Richardson Foster

we'll call that ref Lindsey

printed:  Children of Jacob Hollingsworth and Wife Sarah.pdf

Ancestry has stuff according to the above post

----

Amanda Melvina Hollingsworth Harris to daughter Adeline Fullilove and Adeline’s daughter Evelyn (letters)

This is Richardson's widow remarried to Harris and daughter married into the Fullilove family.  So that would explain the Fullilove's owning Forest Home and the Fullalove Cemetery at Four Corners.

interesting 
Fowlers at Petersburg
Fosters in Amelia Co., just west of there

Thomas Foster
https://sites.rootsweb.com/~fosterameliacova/wmbb/thos_wm_bb.html

https://sites.rootsweb.com/~fosterameliacova/

will names 
Claiborne
William
Jesse
Ludson

Could William be William Claiborne?

Claiborne lived at Amelia
William Claiborne born at ??
Elizabeth Colbert born at NC ??

another lineage has Claiborne Foster (same dates) with
f. William Shepherd Foster
m. Martha Elizabeth Foster Smith

This lineage of William Shepherd Foster
https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LH14-8K7/william-shepherd-foster-i-1718-1792

does not show Claiborne
and has Frederick Foster 1755-1792
supposedly in the 1790 census

Thomas Foster 1732-1799
Prudence Worsham 1732-1799

https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LZXH-LMW/thomas-foster-1732-1799

William 1751-1842
Claiborne 1755-1808
William 1757-1802
Jesse 1759-1798
Kezia 1761-1825
+3


Claiborne Foster 1755-1808
Martha Patsy Griffin 1755-1798
m Oct 21 1784

Claiborne Foster Jr. 1807–1857
this could be Flavel's brother

William Foster 1751-1842
older brother of Claiborne 1755
son of Thomas

also
William Foster 1757-1802
brother of the other 2
m. Elizabeth Hastings 1757
m Oct 6 1779

so at a guess
I like f. Thomas better
and then 
William 1751 or 1757 as father of
William Claiborne Foster < 1780
