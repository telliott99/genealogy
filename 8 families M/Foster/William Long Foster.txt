I sent the following to Find a Grave

William Long Foster's parents were:

Mary Ellen "Nellie" Long Foster
www.findagrave.com/memorial/48101031/mary-ellen-foster

Five children were born on the plantation (near Keachi, DeSoto Parish).
Moved to Shreveport 1870.

There should be three additional children before 1870.  I know two.

William Long Foster Oct 10 1861 - May 11 1916

His memorial does not mention his parents.  The other son is

Claiborne Lee is a graduate of the USMA class of 1888.
He died of fever at Fort Reno in Indian Territory.

Evidence for William Long Foster as the son of James Martin and Nellie

1.  My family history has it so.  My grandfather's obit:

James Heflin Foster
www.findagrave.com/memorial/78540945/james-heflin-foster

"He is a grandson of the late James Martin Foster and son of the late W. L. Foster, railroad commissioner. Mr. Foster's other local connections include the Hollingsworth, Sewall and Blanchard families."

2.  Nellie Long Foster's father was William Long.

3.  William Long Foster's obit mentions

Mrs. Foster-Comegys of New York City
Mrs. T. Olive Foster of this parish, and 
Mrs. Benton McMillan of Nashville, Tenn.

We can match T. Olive as Nellie's daughter and William Long's sister [mistakenly said Aunt in first version].

Also, McMillin is given as the last name of another of Nellie's daughters (and see #4).

4.  There is a long write-up on Nellie which I found here:
http://files.usgwarchives.net/la/natchitoches/bios/fostmrs.txt

It does say "three children born unto them" but I think there were 5 (on the plantation).  
In any event the text reads:

"One of her sons, Claiborne Lee Foster, graduated 
at West Point in 1888 and died in 1890.  He was one of 4 cadet captains 
at the Academy of West Point.  Another son, John Gray Foster, closely 
followed the death of his father in answering the summons of death.  He 
was a brilliant young man of great promise.  The elder of the 2 living
sons is Hon. William Long Foster.  He is the eldest of the 5 surviving 
children of Mrs. Foster.  He is a prominent cotton planter of Caddo 
Parish, and was formerly railroad commissioner for his district in 
Louisiana.  A personal sketch of the younger son, now living Hon. 
James M. Foster immediately follows this of his mother.  The three 
living daughters of Mrs. Foster are Lucille, the wife of former Governor 
Benton McMillin of Tennessee, who served for 20 years in Congress and 
was the author of the income tax law during President Cleveland's 
administration, and is now minister to Peru under the appointment of 
President Wilson; Mrs. M. E. Foster-Comegys, now residing in New York 
City, has 3 daughters who have histrionic talent; and T. Olive Foster, 
now living in Shreveport, and who looks after and manages a plantation 
which she inherited from her father."
