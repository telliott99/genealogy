Will Foster Passes Away

William Long Foster, a prominent Bossier Parish planter, aged fifty-four years, died last Thursday at his Shreveport home. Mr. Foster’s death was not sudden and was not unexpected. He had been in failing health for more than a year and some months ago sold his plantation in this parish and went to Colorado in an effort to recuperate. He did not greatly improve and returned home, and it is thought he realized that his death would soon follow.

In Mr. Foster’s death Bossier Parish and this state have lost an energetic and valuable citizen. He was not only up and doing as a planter here at home and prominent in the local problems of the day effecting the welfare of the parish, but was a thinking man and a leader in movements of such scope that redounded to the good of the state at large. He was at one time secretary at the Shreveport Charity Hospital and was for two terms a member of the State Railroad Commission, which positions he filled creditably. His later retirement to plantation life in this parish was in great measure due to his failing health.

During 1888 Mr. Foster was united in marriage to Miss Mims Davis, of Jackson, Miss., who survives him. Their five surviving children are James H. Foster, Mrs. C. C. Crenshaw and Misses Frances, Eleanor and Lucille Foster, all of whom are now residing in Shreveport, except Mrs. Crenshaw, whose home is in Hillsboro, Texas—Mrs. Foster-Comegys of New York City, Mrs. T. Olive Foster of this parish, and Mrs. Benton McMillan of Nashville, Tenn.—and a number of other relatives survive him.

Of excellent family connection, proud in spirit, true to his convictions, and steadfast toward his friends the deceased was a worthy man. May he rest in peace.
