James M. Foster.  Borne by father and son, this name has been conspicuous 

in Northern Louisiana since Civil war times.  The father was one of the 

largest planters in Caddo Parish, and while he never held a political position 

outside of his home community, he exercised an influence throughout the state 

in behalf of clean government, and was an associate of Governor Murphy J. Foster 

in abolishing the Louisiana Lottery.  The son, James M. Foster, has long enjoyed 

a commanding position as a member of the Shreveport bar, and has also been active 

in politics and business.

studied civil engineering, and for a time was employed in the construction department 

of a railroad.  At the request of his parents he returned home, and after the death 

of his father in 1859 took charge of the family plantation.  Early in the war between 

the states his brothers entered the Confederate army, and it was not easy for him to 

accept the more important duty assigned him of staying at home and keeping the business 

of the farm and plantation at the highest degree of efficiency for the production of 

food and for other services that he could render the community.  The New Egypt 

plantation, as the Foster place was known, was a supply point for foodstuffs f or the 

people all along the Texas-Louisiana border.  He had an opportunity for service as a 

soldier during the Banks Red River expedition, and fought at the battle of Mansfield.  

After that campaign his home was a refuge for sick and wounded soldiers.



In the years following the war he was associated with his brother, Capt. C. J. Foster,

Valley, the crops from which frequently totaled in a single year more than three thousand 

bales.

exception of a few minor trusts imposed on him by his fellow men, relating to the affairs 

of his parish and state from the burden of which he had no desire escape, believing it to 

be his duty as a citizen assume and perform his full share of such responsibilities.
