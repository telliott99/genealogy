Where does info connecting Elijah to Peter Chandler and Mercy Ingalls come from?
It's ref in the post, but where originally?
From wikitree (see below) which cites pension application and will.

Chandler history
has family settled in Nelson (Packersfiled), New Hampshire

wikitree:
children Moses, Elijah, Hannah Ingalls, and Priscilla
Peter's brother who died was named Elijah.

Elijah's supposed to be from Nelson (blog post).  Carpenter

This is the weak link in the genealogy.
I can't find anything on Elijah Chandler.

Peter was in the Revolution.

Peter Chandler was the son of Thomas Chandler and Elizabeth Walcott.

PETER CHANDLER,[1] b. at Andover, 25 Mar 1755 son of Thomas and Elizabeth (Walcott) Chandler; d. at Nelson, NH, 14 Jul 1819; m. 6 Mar 1787, MERCY INGALLS, b. at Andover, 29 Apr 1761 daughter of David and Priscilla (Howe) Ingalls; Mercy d. at Wilton, 12 Feb 1842.

Peter Chandler served during the Revolution from 1775 through 1780. Following his marriage to Mercy Ingalls, the family settled in Nelson (Packersfiled), New Hampshire in 1787 residing on Spoonwood pond also known as “Chandler” pond.[2]

In May 1818, Peter Chandler of Nelson aged sixty-three gave a statement related to his application for pension. He enlisted from Andover, Massachusetts in 1775 in the company of Capt. Ames in the Col. Frye’s regiment for a term of eight months. After that service, he enlisted in Capt. Benton’s company of the Massachusetts line for a term of one year. His third enlistment was on 4 June 1777 for a term of three years in Capt. Frye’s company of Col. Scammel’s regiment of the New Hampshire line. Peter received a pension for his service at the rate of eight dollars per month, and his widow Mercy later received a widow’s pension. A statement by Ebenezer Chandler relates that Peter was wounded by a musket ball in 1776.[3]

In his will written 9 July 1819 (proved 11 September 1819), Peter Chandler bequeathed one dollar to each of his children: Moses, Elijah, Hannah Ingalls, and Priscilla. He bequeathed to his beloved wife any money due from his pension and she receives the residue of the estate to be at her use and disposal during her natural life. Brother-in-law Joshua Holt was named executor.[4]
