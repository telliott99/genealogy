My grandmother Gene Fowler's grandfather was my namesake:
Thompson Fletcher (Tom) Fowler 1836-1886

Her grandmother was Mildred Maria (Minnie) Kuykendall 1847-1932.  There is a picture of her with my mother and my Uncle Jim, taken about 1928-1929.  She looks just like my brother Rob!  [Update:  the photo is actually of her other grandmother A.A. Chandler West Johnson.]

Both lineages go way back in America.  Minnie comes from a branch of the Kuykendalls that is semi-famous in Texas history.  There were two Abner Kuykendalls, her father is the less famous.

According to Robin Fowler (my mother's uncle), Tom Fowler arrived in Texas in the 1850s with his first wife, Martha Smithwick (1843-1865) and her father, Noah.  

Tom had a number of siblings (see marker).

Martha was married at 15-16 and died age 21-22 in Kern County, CA (Bakersfield area).  Her father ran cattle to California with Tom and is buried in Santa Ana, CA.

There is an 1860 census hit for Yolo Co., CA (Sacramento) for Thos. Fowler of correct age 25 and b. Missouri. but no family, occupation laborer and cannot read or write.  Not likely.  He was already married and first child born that year.

They had two children including Charles (1860-1931), who was born in Texas and later became Chief of Police in Nogales, AZ.  The second son was named Wylie (1863-1932), born in California.

TF spent the Civil War in California.  Wylie was born in California.  Charles was sheriff in Santa Cruz, AZ, and Chief of Police in Nogales, AZ.  It is likely not a coincidence that [my mother](jean_francis_foster.md) was born in Nogales.

Martha died in 1865 and is buried in Glennville, Kern Co., CA.  (appears to be a mass grave).  I assume both boys went back to Texas with Tom after their mother died.

Minnie was Tom's second wife.  They were married in 1869 in Texas and had two sons, Eugene George 1870-1931 and Thompson Ernest (Tom) Fowler 1874-1917.  Tom Jr was born near Davilla, TX.

Eugene's marker (second family) says he was born in California in 1870.  So there was a second trip to California.  Eventually Tom came back to Texas with his family and later had a largish (9,000 acre) ranch near Davilla (Bartlett), TX which cost him $24,000.
