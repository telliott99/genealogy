Pope Co History F792 PG475 976.732P 
A study of the history of the WEST family is, in part a study of the history of Pope Co as the two are closely related, the Wests having immigrated to Pope Co while the county was not yet 10 years old. The Wests were descendants of the English Cavaliers and settled in Virginia. 
Their story in Arkansas began with Major David WEST, born at Swansboro, N C January 9, 1792, a son of Andrew and Tryphenia MEDS WEST. Very patriotic and adventurous, he joined the United States Army at an early age. In the war of 1812, he was a private under Andrew JACKSON and fought in the Battle of New Orleans Jan 8, 1815, after peace was declared in England, but before news of the treaty had reached America. Major WEST always said he had served in every war the US ever had against a foreign foe, since the struggle for independence.
After the close of the war of 1812, Major WEST settled in middle Tennessee where he married Miss Milly PAYNE on Nov 11, 1816. Nine children were born to them, namely Joseph B9-11-1817 D12-12-1819; Warren B3-6-1819 D8-4-1839; Caroline B12-6-1820; Phoeby Jane B2-19-1823 D12-26-1906; Thomas B10-6-1824 D9-14-1846; Washington B5-23-1826 D7-8-1827; David Porter B6-3-1831 D7-4-1916; Eliza Ann B10-1-1833 D9-17-1848; Victoria A B4-22-1837. 
Major West came to Arkansas and landed at Old St Martin, near Scotia in Pope Co on May 7, 1839, leaving his family in Tennessee until he could get located. He settled on Piney and sent for his family. Soon after the arrival of his family, his wife and a son, Warren, died of fever. After a respectable length of time, he married Lucinda LATTIMER.
The couple had eight children, Erastus L B2-6-1843 D6-6-1844; Tryphenia B5-8-1845; Andrew North B12-7-1846 D11-15-1866; Alexander H B2-23-1849; Abby Ann B10-27-1859 D9-25-1933; Daniel Webster B1-28-1855 D5-15-1874; John Bell B5-11-1857 D7-24-1946; Emme B B12-20-1859. Major WEST had a total of seventeen children from the two marriages.
When war was declared with Mexico in 1846 Pope Co raised two volunteer companies, one of Cavalry by Capt Symp MOFFIT and the other company of Infantry by David WEST, commissioned as Captain. I have in my possession the original muster roll of Captain WEST's volunteer company known as Company B organized at Dover, Pope Co June 15, 1846. When all the various companies were formed into a Battalion, Capt D WEST received the appointment of adjutant Major. During this war he earned the honory title of "Colonel".
Although Maj WEST was military minded instead of political minded, following his return to Dover after the war he was elected County Judge where he served one term. He also served a term in the Arkansas State Legislature. He died on May 13, 1880 at the age of 88 after a colorful life. His wife, Lucinda LATTIMER West died on Nov 9, 1903 at the age of 82. Some of the David WEST children died in infancy or young man or womanhood. Victoria, Emma and Alex all married at Dover, but soon moved away. Caroline, the oldest daughter, married Samuel M HAYS, who played a prominent part in the making of the early history of Pope Co. Phoebe married Dudley JAMES. Tryphenia married Bennie VanPelt BEWLEY and lived all her life in Dover. David Porter married Ardella Catherine HALLOCK. He also made his home in Dover. Two of his grandchildren, Sue Cathryn WEST SISK and Tommye Belle WEST reside in Russellvile, Ark. John B WEST youngest son of Major David WEST lived in Dover also. He married Margaret Ellen PHILLIPS. He outlived the other 16 children. Some of the grandchildren of Major WEST and many of his great grandchildren still live in Pope Co. Thus Major David WEST still leaves his mark on the county where he settled more than a century ago.
