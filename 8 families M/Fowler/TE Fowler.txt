-----

Tom Jr. (TE Fowler) was my great-grandfather.  When his father died age 50 everything was divided.  Uncle Charles got money, Uncle Wylie got cattle, and Eugene and Tom Jr. got land.  Eventually Tom Jr. sold his land and moved to Bartlett and owned a bank.

Eugene's wife was Minnie Adams Fowler (1883-1976).  I met her when we visited Bartlett in 1970.  She still lived on a ranch near Davilla.

TE died young, from pancreatic cancer, in the hospital in Temple, Texas.  His wife was Augusta Abbey Johnson (1874-1962), known as "Mama Gussie" to us.

The Johnson family history is interesting.  Mama Gussie's mother was named Abbie Ann Johnson (1850-1932) and her father was the famous Indian "fighter" David West (1792-1880).  Robin Fowler's letter to my mother mentions visits back to Arkansas by his mother.  So that would be Mama Gussie going to see her uncle J.B. West (1857-1946).

My grandmother's brothers were Thompson Fletcher Fowler (1901-1970) and Robin Fowler.  Tom was a Captain in the navy and USNA graduate (class of 1925).  He is buried at Arlington.

Robin was born in 1903 and lived in New York and New Hampshire.  Kate and I stayed with him and his wife in the 1980s.

Note:  Gene is buried in Culver City (I had thought she was in Bartlett).

I found them all in the 1940 census in San Marino, CA.
with her second husband William Lienhard.
Also found a marriage cert from Phoenix, 1930.
