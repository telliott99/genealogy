#### Standard notation

There are three sections for each entry.

The first section starts with metadata used to organize the project:  generation as e.g. gen=g5, 

Then, name in bold, born (b), died (d), father (f), mother (m).  These lines and identifiers are present even if there is no data.

```
<gen=g1>

<b>Thomas Anthony Elliott</b>

b 1955 Los Angeles, CA

d --

f [Norman Elliott](../g2/norman_elliott.md)

m [Jean Francis Foster](../g2/jean_francis_foster.md)

```  

If a person was known by some familiar name it is added as {name}.  For a woman, her married (husband's) name is given in parentheses.

In the second section are listed marriages (I chose o as the symbol for that, to be distinguished from m for mother), and then children in a list.  If there's a second marriage they are just listed in order.  I decided to separate info on the date and place of marriage and put it in the third section, also marked with an o.

The third section is also for any other data or references (or even pictures of people or their gravestones), and for discussion of discrepancies.

I have suppressed the birth dates for living individuals, although it is hopelessly exposed to the internet already.
