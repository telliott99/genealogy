I signed up for a free trial with ancestry.com (week of Nov 7 2022).

It's expensive, at more than $300 per year.

They do make it easy to build a tree, by suggesting possible parents.  There are a number of ancestral lines that could be extended into the 18th and 17th centuries that I haven't pursued yet.

It's good at providing census data.  I obtained at least a couple census records that I couldn't find on FamilySearch, but not very many.  I didn't learn anything new from this data.

The most valuable data that could be here, but in general is not, is the will for people where we don't know too much about them.  However I haven't found any of these, at least useful ones.  I found one for TE Fowler but it doesn't add anything.

The ancestral trees from other accounts on the site are disappointing.  They seem to be people with no connection, perhaps they're from the Mormon community.  Lots of bad information, as well.

I did see a few pictures of my uncle John Elliott.  I guess they're from Lisa.

There are a couple of fun pictures from the Fowlers.  It is disappointing that they are of very low resolution.

Dead ends in the Norman Elliott tree at g5.

- Sarah Fisher
- Mary Jane Thorpe
- Lydia Catherine Roberts
- Henry J. Fisher

For the first two I got no additional information.  For Mary Jane, I got a lead on a possible father, whose name was Robertson.

I got leads on possible parents for Henry J.  This only happened because they're all buried together.

That's really everything.
