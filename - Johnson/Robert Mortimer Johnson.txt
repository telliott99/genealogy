Robin says married "before the war" but he must be mistaken.

Robert Mortimer Johnson Johnson age 22
o Abby Ann Chandler age 17

Dover is in Pope Co.
Ages are correct for both;  they were born Dec, Nov.

Robin Fowler's memoir:

p.49
"Mother and I were on our way to visit her parents at Hereford"

Robert Mortimer Johnson was in the Confederate Army.
CSA according to RF memoir, married in Arkansas before the (Civil) War.  

p.59
"mustered out of the confederate army"
"two-year course at Tulane University to obtain a degree to practice medicine."
"lived in a number of small towns, both in Arkansas and northern Texas."

semi-retired in Hereford
I have a grave marker with the same name in Amarillo, TX.

Parents listed as William Johnson and Selinda Rankins.

analysis:
Dr. Robert Mortimer Johnson.  
Married, but no name for wife!  

1845 birthdate is reasonable for him to be father to Mama Gussie b 1874.

Gives occupation as medical doctor, which fits RF memoir.  
Confederate veteran (Potter Co. TX), which fits too.

Hereford is just outside of Amarillo.

Why no mention of wife Abigail?  According to Robin Fowler they were living together at Hereford when he went to visit.

Robert Mortimer's father is likely to be William Johnson (see above)

According to this

William S. Johnson b 1823

says that one son of William and Salinda is actually
