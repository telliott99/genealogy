A page from a history found online shows 
Captain William S. Johnson killed during ACTION AT FAYETTEVILLE, ARK.
Apr 18 1863

The above report references Cabell as "enemy" so unlikely to be ours.

Gen Cabell advanced from Ozark to Fayetteville

"Captain William S. Johnson, company M, First Arkansas Cavalry, had his right arm shattered while leading him men forward under a galling fire. "

this captain was in Company H.

He is certainly not ours, survived, Union Army, b 1841.

"Capt. William S. Johnson
Capt. Wm. S. Johnson, U. S. A.  Captain Johnson is the son of James J.
and Julia (Graham) Johnson, who were from Pennsylvania, and of Scotch-
Irish origin.  His parents moved to Fulton County, Illinois, in 1835,
and it was there that William S. was born, May 7th, 1841.  He was edu-
cated in his native county, and, upon the 8th of April, 1861 enlisted 
as a private in Company A, 4th battalion, District of Columbia, under
President Lincoln's first call, and served three months.  In August,
1862, he came to Springfield, Missouri, and enlisted in the 1st Arkan-
sas cavalry as private, but was promoted to the first lieutenancy in 
October, and in February, 1863 was again promoted to the captaincy of
his company.  He was wounded in the right arm at the battle of Fayett-
ville, Arkansas, and the arm was saved by taking out a section of bone
four and one-half inches in length.  September, 1864 he was transferred
as first lieutenant of the veteran reserve corps at Washington City,
where he was also regimental quartermaster in the provincial cavalry at
K street barracks.  He was at the theatre when Lincoln was assassinated
and had charge of the battalion that acted as escort of the body to the
White House.  In 1866, he was superintendent under Col. J. M. Moore, 
for the building of national cemeteries in the State of Virginia, and
was on duty until June 12th, 1867, when he was transferred to the reg-
ular army and assigned to duty at Fort Wayne as quartermaster.  May 20,
1871 he retired with rank of captain, mounted.  January, 1871 he came
to Springfield and engaged in the photograph business, and followed it
until 1882.  He was married December 28th, 1863 to Miss Nora Oustott.
Their union has been blest with six children, three of whom are living,
viz.: William H., Julia G. and Harry D.  The captain is a Mason, and a
member of the A. O. U. W.
