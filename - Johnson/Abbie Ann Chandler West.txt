has her as Mrs. Abbie Ann West Johnson and her father as [David West](../g6/david_west.md), but does not list her daughter who is our great-grandmother.

NE genealogy has her maiden name as Chandler, I think because that's what on the marriage book entry that I found (10/2022).

I found a death cert for her daughter Augusta, which lists parents as
Abby Ann Chandler West and Robert Mortimer Johnson.

So that seems perfectly clear that it's right, though why Chandler?

Update: I found a blog post (see below) that explains that Abby Ann was the (out-of-wedlock) daughter of Elijah Chandler who was then adopted by the West family when Chandler died in 1860.

I have a letter from Robin Fowler to Francis Elliott [here](../family_data/Johnson/Letter Uncle Robin to My Mother Francis.pdf), stating that his mother (Abigail or Abby Augusta Johnson) used to visit J.B. West in Dover, Arkansas, and that his "uncle" who loved to fight Indians was "on the West side of the family."  That'd be David West.

I found his [grave](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/43770484/john-bell-west/photo#view-photo=71774435) in Dover.  Here is a page I constructed for [John Bell](../g5/john_bell_west.md).

I also found John Bell and Abby Ann's father [David West](../g6/david_west.md) 1792-1880 and their mother as well.  According to several sources, Abby Ann and J.B. are children of David West, so I have incorporated the new material and changed her maiden name on this file.

Find a grave also has Abigail Ann West Johnson as mother of Daniel Robert Johnson (www.findagrave.com/memorial/163619141/daniel-robert-johnson)), but does not mention Abigail Augusta.  I have provisionally included him on a page as well.  

It's interesting that Daniel Robert lived in Phoenix, since that's where Gene Fowler (Foster) moved after Nogales.

I believe that Robin Fowler's memoir mentions a brother Robert.

Today I found the answer to the mystery of Abby Ann, 
my grandmother's grandmother.

My grandmother's mother was called "Mama Gussie".

I have her as Abigail Augusta Johnson (Fowler).

Augusta's first name was Abigail according to Robin Fowler.
He also lists her as Abbie Augusta Johnson Fowler.

FindaGrave 
www.findagrave.com/memorial/24908050/augusta-abey-fowler

The marker just says Augusta Fowler.

Augusta Abey Johnson Fowler 
b Oct 16 1874 Hot Spring Co., AR
d Mar 10 1962 Dallas Co., TX
buried in Bartlett near her husband and her mother.

The marker has her birth year as 1874.
FindaGrave says 1876 (wrong)
Death cert (below) confirms 1874.

Interesting, she was born in Arkansas.

----

How this started:

familysearch for Robert Mortimer Johnson (Augusta's father).
I found a death cert for Augusta Fowler.  The cert says:

Died in Dallas at the "Fowler Home for The Aged".

b Oct 16, 1874 in Dover, AR
d Mar 10, 1962 in Dallas, Williamson Co., TX

f Robert Mortimer Johnson
m Abby Ann Chandler West

So that was the first clue.
A.A.'s surname is given as both Chandler and West.

----

I found a record for

Ella Florence Johnson
b Mar 04 1884
Gainesville, Cooke Co., TX

f Robert Mortimer Johnson
m Abbie Ann Chandler

Gainesville, TX is north of Dallas.
Robin talks about Aunt Ella from Moody (near Waco).
Ella would be Mama Gussie's sister.

It is referenced in familysearch page.  
Original is not available.

----

Mama Gussie also had a brother:
Daniel Robert Johnson
1875-1965

Back to Mama Gussie's mother:

The marker in Bartlett says
Mrs. A.A. Johnson
Nov 27 1850 - Sep 25 1932

No father for A.A. given by FindaGrave.

A blog post explains the whole story.
www.abbottgenealogy.com/single-post/2020/09/10/she-married-my-property-but-not-my-self

I printed it just in case.

Elijah Chandler (1790-1860) of Nelson, NH was a carpenter.  

He married at age 47 to Lydia Burton, but left her to "seek happiness elsewhere".

He settled in Pope Co., AR, where he died in 1860.  
Maj. David West was his executor.  The will states:

“Second, to my wife Lydia B. Chandler (who married my property but not my self and who by her unkind treatment has driven me from my house and home to seek a shelter in the wide world and having at the time I left her given her the greatest portion of my property there is now nothing her due yet because the law requires it) I give her one dollar.”

He gives his daughter Abby Ann Chandler two thousand dollars.

It seems that Abby Ann, age 10, was "adopted" by the David West family.

According to the post, "Abby was raised by David West and his wife Lucinda Latimer and David West is given as her father on her death record."

I don't have that death record.

The post also references a marriage (see below).

Who was the mother?
