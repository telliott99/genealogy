m Miriam Geer (1748-?)

o William Claiborne Foster (<1780 - Aug 30 1835)
- Flavel Foster
- Richardson Foster

----

The Fosters were on the move from Georgia, and lived in Monroe Co., AL for a while.  Flavel was born in Monroeville, and moved on to Louisiana after the death of his father, his mother Elizabeth, and brother Richardson in 1835.  He was 34 that year.

Monroeville is ca 75 mi NE of mobile, toward Montgomery.

I have dates:

Richardson d Mar 18 1835
William C. d Aug 30 1835
Elizabeth  d Nov 02 1835

One source is FindaGrave
https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/64608572/elizabeth-foster#

What evidence they have I don't really know.  I have seen reporting from people who found the graves in a cemetery outside Monroeville, Monroe Co., AL.  (Richardson and Elizabeth but not William C.).  It seems they all dies within a few months in 1835.

In particular 
https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/135039045/richardson-foster
gives the date for Richardson Foster.

The dates for the other two are from the markers.

What source for the birth dates?

It seems likely that he is also in the cemetery at Monroeville but the grave is lost.

A big source is Elizabeth's will.

Elizabeth Foster Will 1 & 2

Reference is Monroe Co., AL Deeds and Wills, Book A, p. 111.

Her executor is William C. Foster, that's her son, not her husband, since he supposedly died in August.

She gives Richardson 3 Negroes.  There's more than one problem, since he's dead by then.

will has
son Richardson Foster, deceased w/ 3 children
son Flavel Foster
daughter Julia B. Manning
son Wm C. Foster.
son John W.
son Frederick Colbert

"The reason I do not provide for him [Frederick Colbert] more liberally is that he has never paid me that attention I consider to be due from a son to a mother."

Name provides circumstantial evidence that her maiden name was Colbert.  Many other Fosters mentioned nearby in the same book.

mentions the cemetery and pictures of the headstones

Amanda (Richardson's wife) remarried.  

I know that later Amanda moved to Caddo Parish with her second husband.  She's buried near Keatchie.

Richardson (Flavel's brother) and he married sisters
Flavel o Mary Hollingsworth
Richardson o Amanda Hollingsworth
