Flavel moved to Caddo Parish in 1842.  
James Martin's write-up and obit (see the memorial) are a good source about that.
James Martin "born in Monroe Co., AL" Apr 25 1831

* Lindsey has birth year as 1807

Flavel is well-known as the father of James Martin Foster and his sibs.

Dates of birth and death for Flavel and Mary from their headstones.

I don't have a marker in his Find a Grave ref.

FindaGrave has death in 1860.

1850 census is said to have him born in GA, but son Claiborne says he's born in VA.

The real key to tie things together is the cemetery in Monroeville, AL where Elizabeth and Flavel's brother Richardson are buried and also Elizabeth Foster's will (see file for her).  It's clear that Elizabeth is the mother of Flavel and Richardson and her husband was William Claiborne Foster.

I'm not sure where I got a date of death for WC but I have

Richardson d Mar 18 1835
William C. d Aug 30 1835
Elizabeth  d Nov 02 1835

Seems to have been a rough year.

If that's right f William Claiborne probably should be in the cemetery at Monroeville since I believe they lived there for a while.  One source said some graves "disappeared."

[1] below gives an alternative history and calls this story "unproven source" but I think it's pretty certain given the markers and the will that this is correct.

Richarson married Amanda Melvina Hollingsworth b May 23 1812 in Franklin Co., GA and d May 02 1862 at Shreveprot.  o Richardson Feb 10 1830, Richardson b Mar 31 1800 in VA, buried in Monroe Co. AL.

more Hollingsworths. Frances and husband William Crosby are buried at Mansfield 1860, 1884.  He remarried 1867.

The Keatchi property is sometimes said to be in Caddo Parish and sometimes in DeSoto.

"There, the families settled in Keatchie, Desoto Parish, Louisiana. Later, they established Forest Home Plantation at Four Forks, Caddo Parish, Louisiana The modern location is west of La. 169 at the end of Firetower Rd."

La. 169 runs NS about 2 mi from Texas border.
"Four Forks" is NW of Keatchie on La. 169.  Just N of there is Firetower Rd.

There is a cemetery.
According to FindaGrave
https://www.findagrave.com/cemetery/67574/fullalove-cemetery

The Fullalove Cemetery in southwest Caddo Parish holds the remains of members of the Fullilove Family, who owned nearby Forest Home Plantation, now long gone. The misspelling in the name is historic and apparently intentional. The cemetery is on private land and is maintained by a neighbor, a Shreveport police detective.

When James Martin moved to Shreveport in 1870 he may have sold out?, but some graves are from e.g. 1852, 1861.

Forest Home Plantation is listed
http://genealogytrails.com/lou/plantatons.html

but no info at that link.  (There are other plantations of the same name).

search for "Forest Home Plantation" AND Foster gives:
https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/217408876.pdf

said to mention "J.F. Foster of ... to engage V.I. Brown as manager of Forest Home"
but p. 208 has Forest Home and Brown but not Foster and indicates it's down near Iberville.

Overview of sugar plantations (they had transitioned from cotton in the 1840s).

Here's a post that's mostly about the Hollingsworths, but has detail on Flavel and Richardson Foster

we'll call that ref Lindsey

Ancestry has stuff according to the above post

----

Amanda Melvina Hollingsworth Harris to daughter Adeline Fullilove and Adelineâ€™s daughter Evelyn (letters)

This is Richardson's widow remarried to Harris and daughter married into the Fullilove family.  So that would explain the Fullilove's owning Forest Home and the Fullalove Cemetery at Four Corners.
