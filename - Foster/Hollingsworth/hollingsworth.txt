Here is one [ref](http://www.sadiesparks.com/jacobhollingsworth.htm), "The Family of .."

My primary source (with some dates that may not be right) is an application from my great aunt Lucille Foster's daughter to a PA society thing (see family data).

A quick summary is [here](../family_data/Hollingsworth/Foster_Hollingsworth.txt).  The key link is the inscription on Mary Amelia's gravestone (which was notarized) and the fact that Jacob and Sarah are buried at Caddo Parish, and what their gravestones say (also notarized, although I don't have the docs).

Jacob Sr.'s will discussed Nov 2 1822, so he died right before that (one or two months).

Note:  dates prior to 1755 are "old style" and not corrected.

Ref says that the 1820 census records for Franklin Co. are lost.

According to [this](../family_data/Hollingsworth/hh_summer12.pdf)

>    Valentine Hollingsworth, Sr. transported his family group and John Musgrave, an indentured servant, aboard The Antelope, with Edward Cooke, Master, from Belfast, Northern Ireland, as part of William Penn’s Quaker settlements of Pennsylvania, arriving during “ye 10th month of 1682” (or December 1682 by modern reckoning).

- Samuel

[wikipedia ref](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine_Hollingsworth)

Note:

The Antelope was part of William Penn's fleet conveying Quakers to the New World [ref](https://www.genealogybranches.com/antelope1682.html).

Valentine (and son) are [not](http://homepages.rootsweb.com/~jayken/hollingsworth/hr/88240224.htm?cj=1&netid=cj&o_xid=0000584978&o_lid=0000584978&o_sch=Affiliate+External) on the passenger list of the Antelope.  But since this is the only vessel of Penn's which sailed in 1682 from an Irish port, it seems likely.

According to [this](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Space:Antelope%2C_sailing_of_1682), Valentine and his wife and four children made the voyage:  Katherine, Thomas, Samuel and Mary, along with a son-in-law and indentured servant.  

There are three more generations!  According to [this](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hollingsworth-33), Valentine's father was

<b>Henry Parker Hollingsworth</b>

<b>Catherine Baker Hollingsworth</b>

It continues

Valentine < Henry < Robert Valentine < Robert b. 1520
