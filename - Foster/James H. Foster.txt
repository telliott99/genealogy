I also have his death cert.  Not much info filled out but the result is quite clear:  suicide by a gunshot wound to the head.

Place:  Public Place, Washington St. 200 block West, in Phoenix
occupation given as Bookeeper / Bank Officer
no time given

Uncle Jim (Foster) told my sister Kate he did it just outside of his bookie's house!
However, address given is next to City Hall and Maricopa Co. courthouse.

He must have been divorced from Nana before her marriage in 1930, 
but no trace of when that happened.
