Looks like (almost) everybody died!
Definitely ties 2nd wife in

Emma and Adelia also buried Monument Park Cemetery

Married twice.  Sara and John from Melvina Greenman.

Not mentioned 
Alberti 1858
Clarence 1856
https://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/clarence-metcalf-24-j0fphx

Ancestry has 
Edward Metcalf and Mary Jane Thorpe as parents of 
Emma Metcalf b 1850

Mary Jane Thorpe (1823-1862) b Denmark, Lewis Co., NY
Emma Metcalf (1850 - Aug 07 1860) b Denmark, Lewis Co., NY

So NE year may be off, and fits age 1855 census, except that her stone says 1820.

----

Ancestry.com
https://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/clarence-metcalf-24-j0fphx

is pretty confident that Edward Metcalf (1800) and Mary Jane Thorpe 
were parents of

Edward Clarence Metcalf b 09 Feb 1856
in Carthage, NY

That's the right place.

So that fits with Edward (1800) as Alberti's father
and this Edward as his brother
They just don't know about Alberti

also Edward Clarence Metcalf died Los Angeles, 1908
according to ancestry.com

if correct, Clarence is Jessie's uncle in LA
so maybe JE Elliott and Jessie met up with him there

that same page says Edward Sr. was born in Ireland

Sister Emma 1849-1860
mother died 1862, that's Mary Jane Thorpe

----

Denmark is very close to Carthage?
Jefferson, Lewis & Oneida Co. all midstate upper
Denmark is in Lewis Co. just south of Carthage

Far upstate NY, near Fort Drum.

Naturalization doc Edward Metcalf 1833

Alberti's obit

b. July 5 1858 son of Edward and Mary Jane Metcalf, Carthage, NY

Seems that Alberti (1858) is a late offspring of Edward (1800)
Edward born in Ireland

obit says Alberti left Carthage for Indianapolis at 18

FamilySearch has 1860 census for Denmark, Lewis Co., NY
Edward Metcalf 60 Farmer b Ireland
Mary 37 Housewife
Sarah A. 28
Wm C 12
Emma 10
Mary 8
Delia 6
Clarence 4 note this is Edward Clarence? C.H.?
Alberti 1

Here is a false lead:

see John Metcalf 1.png (and 2)

John Metcalf is well known to them

His grandfather Edward Metcalf was from Ireland
So who is his father?
If it was Alberti's half-brother, Edward is his father

But it's the wrong place
Jefferson, Washington Co., PA (v. close to Steubenville WV)
1000 acre farm

born about 1800
married Margaret Meneely of Washington Cty

children
Jane, John, William, Nancy, Mary, James, Margaret, Edward, Sarah
Alexander, Judy and an infant

John was born Oct 17 1821 in Washington Cty
Wrong birth date.

What are the chances?  2 Irish guys named Edward Metcalf, immigrants, both born in 1800.  One ends up in Washington Co., PA and the other in New York.
