The middle history of our branch of the Elliotts starts with a relatively well-known figure, David Elliott (1744-1793).

the text says:
David, s. of David and Mehitable, Mar 3, 1744-5

This is old style/new style
The year 1744 isn't over yet even though it's March.
From the next month on, the year would be 1745.

In modern style, the real year should be 1745.
But all the records I've seen have his birth year as 1744!

Another odditity is that his father has the same birthday, Mar 03.

The Elliotts' move west (really, north then west) starts with the birth of David (1744) in Uxbridge, SW of Boston.

On the way, he and his father lived in Dutchess Co., which is only about 50 miles from New York City.  

"Ensign David Elliott who married Deborah Elliot, a first cousin and daughter of John Elliot and Deborah Aldrich. Our Ensign David was born 1744 in Uxbridge and followed his father to Kingsbury after the raid on the Elliott Farm in Dutchess County by the soldiers. He is listed in Beekman Patent Papers as living with wife Deborah and son Peter. 

(This is not the same David who married Lucy Campbell and Hannah Adams), Ensign David died in 1793 in Kingsbury, Washington County, NY and is buried in the Kingsbury Cemetery."

The third David (1784), was reportedly the second son, born at Dutchess Co.

David (1744) died in/near Kingsbury.

That is in upstate eastern New York, north of Albany and south of Ticonderoga, in Washington Co. about 10 miles east of the southern end of Lake George.

His father David (1716) died there as well, a few years later, in 1798.
They are both buried in Kingsbury and there are markers.

William Elliott (1785-1841) (son of Micajah?) is close by there (plot F-12).



----

Deborah wife of David Elliott (1744) (Aug 08 1749 - Jan 03 1838)

"Deborah Elliott appears to have moved west with her sons David & Peter sometime before 1810, as the sons can be found on the 1810 Cayuga County Census records as well as the History of Cayuga County, Deborah lived with David, her son and his family on the 1830 census for Yates County NY, she is buried in the Segar Cemetery, Steuben County NY, which is listed online at Rootsweb."

So the third David moved west with his mother Deborah after the deaths of his father and grandfather at Kingsbury.  Deborah is buried in Prattsburgh in Steuben Co., which is very close to the Finger Lakes.  See the marker.  The date is 1838, about 45 years later.

"David & Deborah Elliott known children were Peter, David and William."  There are more listed elsewhere."

Of these:
"William married a woman by the name of Keziah and lived and died in Washington County NY (I have copies of his will and probate records)."

"Peter is still up in the air, but it seems he married Phebe Holly and Phebe Reeves and had many children, he is found on the 1850 census in Lake County OHIO with son Isreal."

from David Elliott 1784 story (my title) obtained from Ancestry.com
entry by Melanie Hollett

David Elliott, the son of David Elliott and Mehitable Aldrich, born 1744 in Uxbridge Mass, married Deborah Elliot, daughter of John Elliot and Deborah Aldrich. This couple, David and Deborah were first cousins, and marriage between cousins was quite common in the 1700's. They and the majority of this Elliott family, along with David's parents moved to New York settling on the Beekman Patent in Dutchess County in the Pawling area around 1760 after the Native American uprisings were more settled. They traveled from Massachusetts through Connecticut by wagon. When they arrived in Pawling David, David's father leased a farm near his cousins and brothers farms. David met and married Deborah Elliot in Pawling about 1770. According to Beekman Patent papers David wife Deborah and son Peter leased a farm, later moving to his fathers leased property about 1775. All civil records of Pawling were destroyed by fire for the 1775-1786 time period. The First Baptist Church of Wingdale, where the family attended did not keep birth, marriage or death records. David and Deborah's children can only be speculated on, through various sources we are certain of Peter, David and William Elliott. David was an ensign in the Revolutionary War for the Pawling Militia. He retired from the Militia in 1786 as a Captain. He then moved his family to the Kingsbury area of New York to join his father and mother who had moved there. A tax list from Harper's Field lists a David Elliott for the year of 1788. So he remained in Pawling until after 1788. David is found on the Kingsbury census for 1790. He died August 3, 1793 and is buried in the Kingsbury Cemetery. His wife Deborah Elliott, was given the land bounty rights for her deceased husband, 500 acres in Cayuga County. She and her children David and Peter were in the Cayuga County area by 1810 according to census records. David and Peter are written about in Cayuga County history as clearing land in and around Scipio town. Deborah is next found on the 1830 census with her son David and family. Listed as a female between 80 and 90 years of age. She died Janaury 3rd 1838 and is buried in Segar Cemetery,  Steuben County NY. Her listing states her age at 88 years 4 months 26 days.
