farmer
cause of death prostatic hypertrophy and Uremic toxemia
attested by David Elliott, Hillsdale, IN

James obit says:  sister-in-law, Mrs. Clara Elliott, 
son of Alonzo (sic) and Sarah Fisher Elliott.  

which just shows you can't rely on obits too much.

f Alanson Elliott b NY, m Sarah Fisher b NY

These guys are all in the same cemetery (Oakland)

search for Sarah Elliott 1850 census b 1821 
Independence, Allegany Co. gives a hit

middle of the page

Lanson Elliott M 25
Sarah Elliott 29 F

Eliza Fisher 16 F

David's wife Mary Polly Squires.
Eliza is probably Sarah's sister?  

Mistake for Lanson's age, should be 35.
which is why many genealogies list him as b 1825

Reasons 1815 is correct:  
1840 census
grave marker

This could be Eliza

Alanson at Union Cemetery, Willing, Allegany Co. NY.  
Willing is not on the map anymore as a town. 
Google puts it on the Pennsylvania state line about 75 miles east of Erie, PA.

The cemetery is called either Union or Beach Hill Cemetery and it is in Willing.  

Since there are a lot of people from the Beach family there, 
I think the spelling is Beach Hill, not Beech Hill, as FindaGrave has it.

Here's a page online for "Union or Beach Hill Cemetery Willing, NY"
https://www.paintedhills.org/ALLEGANY/UnionCem.html

Union Cemetery is located on the South side of County Rt. 39, 
about 3 miles east of Yorks Corners in Willing Township, Allegany Co., N. Y.

Alanson (b. 1815)
Mar 16 1859 - 43 y 8 m 20 = Jun 26 1815
(not counting leap days!)

David (*) (1784-1854)
wife Polly (b. 1803)

Polly's age is given as 83 in this write-up
But the picture of the stone clearly shows 93 yr old
The 1793 year is based on info from Sara L. Johnson.

David (1830-1901) was Alanson's brother.
wife Elmira (b. 1826)
I guess 2nd wife Amanda
