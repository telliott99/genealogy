Sarah Fisher is named on the death certificate for 
both John and James B. Elliott.
Sarah Fisher
b NY

The birth date is from 

I know almost nothing about her.
The death in Montezuma, IN is from Norman Elliott's genealogy.

Sarah seems not to be in Oakland Cemetery, 
where her son David Marion and his brother James is.

Alanson is known to have lived in various counties in Western NY.

----

I have Sarah in the census several times, 
before and after Alanson's death in 1859.

1850 census Independence, Allegany Co., NY

Lanson Elliott 25 M
Sarah Elliott 29 F
John " 2 M
Ema " 1 F
Eliza Fisher 16 F

Lanson's age is an error (b 1815, so 35 yo).
Place of birth given as NY for all except Eliza, not given.
Guess that Eliza may be Sarah's sister.

----

1855 NY state census shows Sarah b Yates Co. and has David 11/12.

Alanson Elliott 39 M b Cayuga Co.
Sarah Elliott 36 F wife b Yates Co.
John Elliott 7 M son b Allegany Co.
David Elliott 11/12 M son b Allegany Co.

----

1860 census Willing Allegany Co., NY
Sarah Elliott age 39 F
John age 12 M
David age 5 M
James age 1 M

Place of birth NY for all.

I had a possible hit in 1865 New York state census.

New York State Census in Sheridan, Chauauqua Co.  That is far western NY very close to the lake.

Joseph Elliott age 56 b Delaware married to Sarah
Sarah Elliott age 44 F "wife" b Vermont
Mary Elliott age 18 daughter b Chautauqua
David Elliott age 10 son b Chautaqua

Ages are right for Sarah and David!

problems:
Seems unlikely that she picked up a daughter age 18 since 1860.
And second husband *also* named Elliott?
b Vermont isn't consistent

But the original NY could be an error and second marriage etc.
We need to find Joseph Elliott.
