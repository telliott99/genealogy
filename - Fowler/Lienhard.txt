I used Family Search and found mother and Nana in the 1940 census.

2170 Sherwood Rd. San Marino

Lienhard, William  43
   "    , Gene     36
Foster, Jean F.    14
Foster, James T.   11

I also found a marriage cert from Phoenix Jul 19 1930

Note that Nana often gave her age as younger than she was!
Born Jan 27 1898.
At the time of the marriage, she was 32, given as 28 (and key is worn looks like 26).
At the time of the 1940 census, she was 42.
