#### Project notes

This project records the genealogy of my family.  It is based on the [family tree](figs/ne_genealogy.png) constructed by my father, [Norman Elliott](source/g2/norman_elliott.md).

When I was young, we would go to the local public library on Tuesday nights, sometimes we would go to bigger libraries where he could look at microfilm of the U.S. census.  My Dad traced all of his and my mom's parents back to my grandparents' grandparents.

The hope is that this material will be revised and extended in the future, as I do more or as some other family member gets interested.  Or at least, that it will be preserved along with the rest of the internet.

#### markdown

The structure of the project evolves.  Initially, the  format was all [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).  Markdown supports links but is much easier for humans to write than html.  

If you view the files as plain text, they may look a little strange if you are not used to it, but it's definitely readable.  You can view the source for the pages in any text editor.

Or you can just continue to view them as they are here on Github, rendered by your browser as html.

Markdown allows easy incorporation of a variety of material including photos, text, and links to external web pages.  If you download or clone the project, the pages will be a lot nicer with any of a variety of free markdown viewers or editors that are available.

The files are organized by generation.  I call the grandparents' grandparents' generation g5;  I am g1 and my son is g0.

#### example

Here are my mother, [Jean Frances Foster (Elliott)](source/g2/jean_frances_foster.md), and her  younger brother Jim, together with their great-grandmother.  

<img src="portraits/GM Johnson.png" style="width: 400px;" />  

I follow the genealogical convention of recording names of everyone as their name at birth, or so-called "maiden" name.  Married names, when shown, are in parentheses.

The photograph was annotated by my grandmother, Gene Fowler.  I recognize Nana's handwriting.  It says "Grandmother Johnson", i.e. her grandmother, my mother Fran's great-grandmother, [Abby Ann West](source/g5/abby_ann_west.md).  

I'm not sure of the place, it says "at Mama Gussie's".  My mother is said to be 2-1/2 and Jim is 4 mo, so it's the summer of 1928.  Abby was born in Nov 1850 and was then 77 years old.  Abby's father fought with Andy Jackson at the battle of New Orleans in 1815.  Her husband fought in the Civil War.  Not that long ago, really. 

To start exploring, you could look at a [tree](trees/te.txt) I constructed for myself, at the links in this page, or at [my page](source/g1/thomas_anthony_elliott.md).  Or just browse the folders in ``source``.

Another way to view the data is to construct trees.  I have written a few Python scripts to extract the basic information from each individual's file into a single textfile database.  See [scripting](markdown/scripting.md).

#### evidence

More recently, it's become clear that a second major purpose, in addition to filling out family trees, is to provide evidence for all the relationships, dates, and places.

I'm finding plain text more suitable for that.  Each of my grandparent's family names is the name of a folder, and inside those folders are files that write up evidence relating to an individual.  The backing bits of data are also there.

#### highlights

- I have found both parents for almost all of the g5 generation.  Altogether I have names for more than 150 individuals beyond g5.  

Some of these may be not be correct, the evidence is in the files.  For example, in a few cases I know only that a person of the right age is buried right next to what I presume is his or her spouse.

- I have confirmation that [Alanson Elliott](source/g5/alanson_elliott.md)'s father David's father was a well-known Elliott, [David Elliott](source/g7/david_elliott_1744.md) with a family extending back to about 1651.  

It is believed that the prototypical [Daniel Elliott](source/g11/daniel_elliott_1640.md) was transported to the colonies after being on the losing side (he fought for the Crown) in one of the battles the Scots fought against Cromwell in 1651.  The original Daniel may have been the same one killed by Indians in 1690.  However, there are other candidates for the first generation of Elliotts in America.

The first I'm sure about is also Daniel Elliott, born in 1662.  He is famous for testimony at the witchcraft trials in Salem in which he said the girls were lying and that they had told him "they must have some sporte".

- As you may know, [T.F. Fowler](source/g5/thompson_fletcher_fowler.md) had the great good luck to be in California when the Civil War started.  His second son with his first wife was born there.  

After returning to Texas and marrying [Minnie Kuykendall](source/g5/mildred_maria_kuykendall.md), he went back to California again, and his son [Eugene Fowler](source/g4/eugene_fowler.md), namesake of my grandmother, was born in Sacramento in 1870.

- I found [Mama Gussie](source/g4/abigail_augusta_johnson.md)'s mother's family, namely [Abby Ann West](source/g5/abby_ann_west.md) and her grandfather [Major David West](source/g6/david_west.md).  And I found a blog post that solves the mystery of her true ancestry through a character named Elijah Chandler.

- Our ancestors include an [Abner Kuykendall](source/g6/abner_kuykendall_1807.md) who is not the famous one of Stephen Austin's [Old 300](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Three_Hundred), but who was also a Texas Pioneer and fought in the Texas Revolution.  The famous [Abner Kuykendall](https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fku04) and ours share a great-great-grandfather.

- I connected [James Martin Foster](source/g5/james_martin_foster_1831.md) (James Heflin's grandfather) with his [mother](source/g6/mary_amelia_hollingsworth.md), a Hollingsworth.  The Hollingsworths go all the way back in American history.  In fact, most families that were in New England in 1780 or so go back at least 130 if not 150 years.

J.M. Martin's brother [Jacob Flavel](source/g5/jacob_flavel_foster.md) was killed at the [Battle of Chancellorsville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Chancellorsville), 1863.  Several more ancestors were in the Confederate army.

- I have Fowler, Hollingsworth and Kuykendall back to the immigrants in the 1600s.  One was here in 1646.  His name was [Jacob Luursen van Kuykendall](source/g11/jacob_luursen_van_kuykendall.md).  Actually, he was Jacob Luursen and he came from Kuykendall, Netherlands, but that's another story.
