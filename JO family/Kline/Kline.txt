familysearch says that
US Census 1940
has Jack in Salem, OR since 1935 age 32 birth date 1908 (est) single lodger
but the linked image doesn't show his name

ancestry says 1940 census has
Lodger in the Ullman residence.
I found Ullman on that page.

I think he's just on the next page.
Yes!
Jack C. Kline, 32, single, lodger
address:  650 Marion, Salem, Marion Co.

He's also in the 1910 census in Spokane age 2

b Dec 05 1907 Spokane Co., WA

There was some issue with the marker having the wrong date
and it would cost too much to fix it.
OTOH if he was born late in 1907 then the age in the census would be 22, 32 etc.

There's an obit but it's paywalled (Genealogy Bank).
There is another one in the Oregonian.

Gives his middle name as Christopher, not correct.

I'm sure FindaGrave is wrong.
Joan says his middle name was Cyrus (maternal grandfather).
There's a draft card with Jack Cyrus Kline at ancestry.

does not list Joan as child!
