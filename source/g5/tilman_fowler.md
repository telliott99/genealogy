> Tilman Fowler was born in Missouri and in 1848 traveled by covered wagon with his parents and siblings to Gonzales, Texas. He served during the Civil War in Company A, 7th Texas Infantry. He came to California in 1884 (1864?) and through the years worked as a stock raiser and farmer. He retired in 1921 and lived in Santa Cruz until his death. He was married 1st to Miss Mollie Sharp, 2nd to Mrs Missouri Higgins and lastly to Miss Isabelle Ybarra on March 2, 1896. He was survived by his wife Belle, their son Harold Lee Fowler and seven grandchildren. Tilman was preceeded in death by his first two wives and son Tilman Jr.

probably 1884 is a typo for earlier..

Not positive whether the children are with the 2nd wife or 1st.

7th Regiment of Texas
known as Gregg's Regiment Texas Infantry
[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7th_Texas_Infantry_Regiment)

organized Nov 9 1861 Hopkinsville KY

captured at Ft. Donelson, TN Feb 15 1862

released at Vicksburg MS about Sep 30 1862

reconstituted and later fought at Tennessee

service record says T. Fowler (Tilman)
was on the muster roll Jan & Feb 1863
enlisted Oct __, 1861
last paid Oct 31, 1862

so I guess he must have been captured at Ft. Donelson and paroled.
