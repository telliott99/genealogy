o1 Matilda b Nov 03 1840 d Mar 31 1873

Buried at Westview Cemetery, Prairie City, Jasper County, IA.  

His son Lewis F. Main was born in Prairie City and also died there in 1935.

"Main" not found in 1860 census Parke Co., IN.

Why would he have a young son left in Prairie City?

Maybe Matilda died, he married Catherine in IN, but then he died in 1861, and they took him back to his family to be buried and left the little boy with relatives?

Possibly father is [Christopher Main](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/37568683/christopher-main)



There is another Lewis Main born in 1830 in Ohio, and buried in Iowa, who was a private in the Civil War.  He died in 1907.  His obit is in the notes.
