Sometimes called Abigail Ann but usually Abby Ann or A.A.

Find a [grave](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/24908013/abbie-ann-johnson) has her as Mrs. Abbie Ann West Johnson and her father as [David West](../g6/david_west.md), but does not list her daughter who is our great-grandmother.

NE genealogy has her maiden name as Chandler, I think because that's what on the marriage book entry that I found (10/2022).

I found a death cert for her daughter Augusta, which lists parents as
Abby Ann Chandler West and Robert Mortimer Johnson.

I have a letter from Robin Fowler to Francis Elliott [here](../family_data/Johnson/Letter Uncle Robin to My Mother Francis.pdf), stating that his mother (Abigail or Abby Augusta Johnson) used to visit J.B. West in Dover, Arkansas, and that his "uncle" who loved to fight Indians was "on the West side of the family."  That'd be David West.

I found his [grave](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/43770484/john-bell-west/photo#view-photo=71774435) in Dover.  Here is a page I constructed for [John Bell](../g5/john_bell_west.md).

I also found [David West](../g6/david_west.md) 1792-1880 and his wife as well.  According to several sources, Abby Ann and J.B. are children of David West.

Find a grave also has Abigail Ann West Johnson as mother of Daniel Robert Johnson ([grave](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/163619141/daniel-robert-johnson)), but does not mention Abigail Augusta.  I have provisionally included him on a page as well.  

It's interesting that Daniel Robert lived in Phoenix, since that's where Gene Fowler (Foster) moved after Nogales.

I believe that Robin Fowler's memoir mentions a brother Robert.
 
Update: I found a blog post today that explains that Abby Ann was the (out-of-wedlock) daughter of Elijah Chandler who was then adopted by the West family when Chandler died in 1860.

Elijah Chandler's line is well-described and he is a descendant of Robert Russell of Andover, MA.
