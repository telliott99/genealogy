o2 Dec 16 1869

Probably called "T.F." but possibly "Tom" like his son and many others after.

Buried at Laughlin Cemetery, Milam Co., TX. 

According to Robin Fowler, TF came to TX with his father-in-law Noah Smithwick, then he and his brother Tilman went to California with Noah, driving cattle.

Sibs: see mother [Dinelah Huff](../g6/dinelah_huff.md), including [Tilman Fowler](../g5/tilman_fowler.md).  Tilman died in Santa Cruz, CA.

Spent the Civil War in California.  Wylie was born in California.  Charles was sheriff in Santa Cruz, AZ, and Chief of Police in Nogales, AZ.  It is likely not a coincidence that [my mother](jean_francis_foster.md) was born in Nogales.
