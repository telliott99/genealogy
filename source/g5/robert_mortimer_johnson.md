CSA according to RF memoir, married in Arkansas before the war.

I think this is his grave:  [ref](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/16896009/robert-mortimer-johnson) 

Dr. Robert Mortimer Johnson.  Data:  married, but no name for wife!  1845 birthdate is reasonable for him to be father to "Mama Gussie" b 1875.

Gives occupation as medical doctor, which fits RF memoir.  And > 1910 death.   Also:  Confederate veteran (Potter Co. TX), which fits too.  Llano is not far to the west of Barlett (although his brother lived in Ft. Worth).  But why no mention of wife Abigail?
