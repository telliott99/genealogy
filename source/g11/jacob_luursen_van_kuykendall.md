> When he arrived in the New World in 1640, Jacob signed his full name as Jacob Luursen Van Wageningen, the word van meaning from, thus establishing that he was from Wageningen, Holland, although some genealogists believe he was actually born in Land Van Kuyk, a county about 12 miles south of Wageningen. This area, probably known at the time as Kijk-in-t-dal, lies on a high bank above the Rhine river and it said to have a beautiful view of the Rhine valley. Kijk is an old Dutch word for view and it is pronounced as if it were spelled Kuyk or Kike. Mr. Van Laar, a New York State Archivist in 1919, maintained that in the Dutch dialect of the Wageningen area, Kijkinstdal may have been spelled Kuykendall or Kuukendal.
