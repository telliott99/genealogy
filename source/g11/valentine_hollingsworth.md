Valentine is buried at Neward Union Cemetery.  The marker is pretty big.  He is described in a family history (see son Samuel) as a native of Cheshire, England, but emigrated from Armagh.

According to [this](../family_data/Hollingsworth/hh_summer12.pdf)

>    Valentine Hollingsworth, Sr. transported his family group and John Musgrave, an indentured servant, aboard The Antelope, with Edward Cooke, Master, from Belfast, Northern Ireland, as part of William Penn’s Quaker settlements of Pennsylvania, arriving during “ye 10th month of 1682” (or December 1682 by modern reckoning).

Note:

The Antelope was part of William Penn's fleet conveying Quakers to the New World [ref](https://www.genealogybranches.com/antelope1682.html).

Valentine (and son) are [not](http://homepages.rootsweb.com/~jayken/hollingsworth/hr/88240224.htm?cj=1&netid=cj&o_xid=0000584978&o_lid=0000584978&o_sch=Affiliate+External) on the passenger list of the Antelope.  But since this is the only vessel of Penn's which sailed in 1682 from an Irish port, it seems likely they came on it.

According to [wikitree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Space:Antelope%2C_sailing_of_1682), Valentine and his wife and four children made the voyage:  Katherine, Thomas, Samuel and Mary, along with a son-in-law and indentured servant.  

There are three more generations!  According to [wikitree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hollingsworth-33), Valentine's parents were:

<b>Henry Parker Hollingsworth</b>

<b>Catherine Baker Hollingsworth</b>

It continues:

Robert Valentine < Robert b. 1520
