I believe his S, GS, GGS, and GGGS are described here:

The ships were:  
Unity 
John and Sara
Liberty

There are only partial, reconstructed passenger lists.  I have not come across a Daniel Elliott, though I do find

Elder/Elyer Daniel [ref](https://scottishprisonersofwar.com/battle_of_dunbar_pows_america/)
[ref](https://scottishprisonersofwar.com/daniel-elder-20-on-the-dunbar-prisoners-list/)
captured at Dunbar ().  Married to Lydia Homes 12th day of 1 mo 1661.  That's a good date for me.  I ran across Homes somewhere else??

died at Dorchester on 4 May 1692.

I don't believe Elder is him.  They had the name straight by this time, also Daniel and Lydia had a son Daniel 1675 so that date is wrong for us, too.

Extensive research on Daniel [here](https://massachusettselliottfamily.tribalpages.com) and [printed](../family_data/Elliott/daniel_elliott_1640.pdf).
