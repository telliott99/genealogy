> Robert appears very early in the Court Records of Northampton County, VA as the servant of the Lady Elizabeth Dale. He worked on one of her cattle plantations, but later became a butcher. The records indicate that Robert West married Elizabeth and had a son named George West, born c1639. When Elizabeth died Robert remarried to a widow by the name of Mary Rayne. Mary's infidelity was well documented in a flamboyant court case. Robert died before his wife leaving George with his step-mother. Details on Robert West include my theory on his arrival to Virginia.
