Note:  the year really should be 1745 (new style), but everyone uses 1744 anyway.

Served as an Ensign in the Militia in 1785.

There is a bunch of history which links
David 1744 > David 1716 > Daniel 1687 > Daniel 1662.

The trick is to link this David 1744 to the one I think is his son, David 1784.  So far the link is that this David 1744 is recorded as having died in 1793 in Kingsbury, NY. (his father David 1716 died there as well, in 1798).  Kingsbury is in Washington Co.  

> [David 1784] Lived in New York all of his life, from Washington County, Cayuga County, Yates County and Allegany County respectively.

Perhaps they are all in the 1790 census.  David 1744's [grave](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/161574861/david-elliott)
That reference says his children are as listed above, including David.

The death date is Aug 04 1793.

[ref](http://www.themorrisclan.net/GENEALOGY/ELLIOTT%20David%20and%20Deborah%20Elliott.html) birth month is given as Mar.

This last reference makes the link that I want to make.  It lists David (no birth date, but with a superset of the siblings from find a grave) as son of David 1744.

> David ELLIOTT. In the 1810 Cayuga County Census records as well as the History of Cayuga County, and on the 1830 census for Yates County NY. David Elliott married Mary Squiers (Squires) daughter of Heman and Keziah Squires, sometime before 1810 in Cayuga County, and had children John, Alanson (Lanson), Warren, David, Heman, Hester Ann, Deborah Ann, Mary "Polly" and Clarissa.
