NE has birth month as Sep, this month is based on the grave marker.  TEF is buried at the Bartlett City Cemetery (Sec 2, Row 3).

NE has his middle name as Earnest, but Robin Fowler (his son) has it as Ernest, so I have changed to reflect that.

According to Robin, he was called "Tom", as was his son.  Robin's memoir says he made a living buying and selling ranches and other property.
