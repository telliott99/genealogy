Buried at Greenwood Cemetery, Shreveport.  

Served four years in the Louisiana House of Representatives.

He was a lobbyist for Standard Oil, among others, and a mortal enemy of the famous governor, Huey Long.

Anyway, there is a story about Huey, well actually about Earl Long, his brother, that Earl called Harney Bogan an SOB, and Harney punched him, and in the middle of the fight, Earl Long bit him on the ear.  Harney ran into the Louisiana legislature bleeding like a stuck pig, as the saying goes.  Chaos ensued.

When he heard of it Huey said:  "I bet Earl bit him, didn't he.  Earl always bites."
