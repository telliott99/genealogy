Called "Fran".

o Oct 14 1944 Los Angeles, CA

Frances is on 2nd birth certificate.  "Francis" is how she spelled it (I think?)

Fran was born in Nogales in 1925.  Her brother Jim was born in 1928 either in Nogales or Phoenix.  

Fran and her mother Gene, who we called Nana, lived in Phoenix before Gene re-married in 1930 and moved to Los Angeles (San Marino). 

We five were born and raised in Los Angeles, near Western Ave.  (111 S. Van Ness, for much of the time).
