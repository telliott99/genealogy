Deborah Elliott appears to have moved west with her sons David & Peter sometime before 1810, as the sons can be found on the 1810 Cayuga County Census records as well as the History of Cayuga County, Deborah lived with David, her son and his family on the 1830 census for Yates County NY, she is buried in the Segar Cemetery, Steuben County NY, which is listed online at Rootsweb. David & Deborah Elliott known children were Peter, David and William. William married a woman by the name of Keziah and lived and died in Washington County NY (I have copies of his will and probate records)Peter is still up in the air, but it seems he married Phebe Holly and Phebe Reeves and had many children, he is found on the 1850 census in Lake County OHIO with son Isreal. Son, David Elliott married Mary Squiers (Squires) daughter of Heman and Keziah Squires, sometime before 1810 in Cayuga County, their children were John, Alanson (Lanson), Warren, David, Heman (My G-G), Hester Ann, Deborah Ann, Mary "Polly" and Clarissa.
