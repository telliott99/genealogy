> Just found a copy of the will of Elizabeth Foster, 1835, recorded in Monroeville, Alabama, this was the mother of my direct ancestor, Richardson Foster, mm Amanda Melvina Hollingsworth, produced 3 children, Elizabeth Adeline Foster, b. 1831, Thomas Foster, b. 1834, Richardson Foster, b 1836. Both the boys died early, would like to know if anyone has a lead where I might find death records/burials for Richardson and the boys. Also, anyone who might know about the rest of Elizabeth's family: William C. Foster, Prudence Segan, Flavel Foster and Frederick Colbert. Thanks

> I know where the graves of Elizabeth Foster, Richardson Foster, Anna McDaniel and a Foster child buried next to Richardson are located. It is right across the road from some of my famlies property east of Monroeville. I have often wondered about this family as nobody seems to be related to them around here. I found where she and Richardson purchased land near their graves in the mid 1820's to 1830's. I have attached pictures of the headstones which are very nice as compared to others in the area of the same age. I found Richardson's headstone lying flat and partially buried. I had to remove a few inches of earth to find out who the headstone belonged to. Several years back I posted this info on a Foster family page and someone from LA e mailed me and said Richardson's wife later remarried and moved to Louisanna and was related to them.

Census of 1810 for Georgia would have been good, but the British burned the records.
