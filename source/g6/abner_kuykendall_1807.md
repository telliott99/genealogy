There is a famous Abner Kuykendall who lived about this time [ref](https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fku04).

At first I thought this was ours, but the dates were wrong.  Then I followed:

brother Robert Hardin (1788-1831) [ref](https://www.geni.com/people/Capt-Robert-Kuykendall/6000000010099287362)

(Abner was stabbed to death in 1834.  Both Abner and Robert H.'s graves have been lost.)

Their father Adam Robert  (1750-1825) [ref](https://www.geni.com/people/Adam-Kuykendall/6000000011061011892)

his father Peiter (sp?) (1718-1783) [ref]

his father Mattheus [Mattheus van Kuykendall](../g9/mattheus_van_kuykendall.md) (1690-1754)

his father Luur [Leur Jacobsen van Kuykendall](../g10/leur_jacobsen_van_kuykendall.md) (1650-1720)

So the famous one's great-great-grandfather is the same as Abner Kuykendall (sons were Cornelius and Mattheus).

Another Kuykendall I came across is Abner Absalom Kuykendall [ref](https://www.wikitree.com/genealogy/Kuykendall-Family-Tree-47) 1818-1919.  Our Abner has a brother Absalom Abner Kuykendall (1814-1901)!

But ... Find a grave says:

"Fought in the Texas Revolution having arrived from Desoto County, Mississippi in January, 1831."  So maybe he was there but just not famous.

His grandfather Abraham Kuykendall is DAR Ancestor #A067617 (FAG Memorial #6740564)  And that is the name of this one's grandfather.

I couldn't find him under this number but I did under #A067605.  The records say he was in the militia.  He was in his fifties at the time of the revolution.

His grandfather Col. William Johnson is DAR Ancestor #A063829 (FAG Memorial #43724075).  This guy was supposedly on George Washington's staff.
