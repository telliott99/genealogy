Find a [grave](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/31169496/david-west) shows him as Major David West.  The page lists Abbie Ann West (Johnson) as a daughter.

The of spouses and children are taken from extensive commentary on that page.  I printed that out so [here](../../gravestones/Maj David West Memorial.pdf) so as not to lose it.

Also [data](../../family_data/johnson/david_west.txt)

He fought with Andrew Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans 1815, also fought in the War with Mexico.
