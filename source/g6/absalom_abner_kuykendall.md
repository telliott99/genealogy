There is a famous Abner Kuykendall who lived about this time [ref](https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fku04).  Unfortunately, ours is probably a different Abner Kuykendall, by these dates  1777?-1834.  

Another one is Abner Absalom Kuykendall [wikitree](https://www.wikitree.com/genealogy/Kuykendall-Family-Tree-47) 1818-1919.  This Abner has a brother Absalom Abner Kuykendall!

Find a grave says:

Fought in the Texas Revolution having arrived from Desoto County, Mississippi in January, 1831.

His grandfather Abraham Kuykendall is DAR Ancestor #A067617 (FAG Memorial #6740564)

His grandfather Col. William Johnson is DAR Ancestor #A063829 (FAG Memorial #43724075)

So maybe he was also in Texas but he is not "the" Abner Kuykendall.

Findagrave is pretty sure his father is Mathew [grave](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/178356104/mathew-kuykendall)

Buried at 	Saints Oakwood Cemetery
San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas, USA
