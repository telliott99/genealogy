The family tradition of Henry HUFF, son of Phillip, that he was of Dutch descent may have some relevance.

[printout](../family_data/fowler/Philip_Huff_wikitree.pdf)

Discounted because the dates are wrong:   The Huff brothers were sons of Philip Hoff who came to Philadelphia from Rotterdam, arriving December 30, 1768. He died in Montgomery Co VA ca 1823.
