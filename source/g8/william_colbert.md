Sophia Hoya lived to be 115 yo.

10 children altogether of this marriage.

Notes on FindaGrave for Elizabeth Colbert [here](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/64608572/elizabeth-foster) indicate that William Claiborne Foster is mentioned in the will of Elizabeth Colbert's father.  (Some kind of restriction on copying in the browswer or printing out).

Clearly the info about death is not from the father's will!  Also, a suggestion that Hancock Co. later split and part became Baldwin Co.
