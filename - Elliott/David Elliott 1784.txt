Summary of the two Davids (1744 and 1784)):

FindaGrave entry says David was born in Dover Plains, Dutchess Co. NY in 1784 and died Wellsville, Allegany Co., in western NY on 15 Jun 1854, and is buried in Beach Hill Cemetery (Allegany, NY).  (Beach not Beech b/c named after Beach family)

Wellsville is about 75 mi due south of Rochester and west of the Finger Lakes.  It's about 300 miles from Washington Co.  Allegany Co. is even further west.

David (1784)'s wife was Mary Polly Squires Elliott (1793-1886) "buried at Beech [Beach] Hill with her husband, David Sr. and her son, David Jr."

The Beach Hill stone in the picture is for Alanson's brother, David, died 1901.

We have David (1744)'s wife as Deborah and history that says she moved west with David (1784), and they are buried together in Beach Hill Cemetery.  (but they aren't).  The graves also link David (1784) and his son Alanson.

Except that Deborah b Aug 8 1749 o David Elliott b 1744 is in Segar Cemetery in Prattsburgh
