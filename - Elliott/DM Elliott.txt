David Marion is Alanson and Sarah Fisher's son according to NE genealogy.
NE also shows David Marion born in Willing, NY.

David Marion died in Los Angeles, but is buried back in Montezuma, Indiana, along with his wife Clara Etta (Clarrie) Main Elliott (1860-1934).  Clarrie is on the stone.  

David's death cert from Los Angeles shows him as single.

What's the evidence that David Marion's father is Alanson?
Census data, see Alanson Elliott and Sarah Fisher

----

Although it's possible that my Dad Norman (b. 1923) knew David (1854)'s wife (Norman's grandmother), and she told him, it seems unlikely given the death cert.    I don't know that she was in Los Angeles, only that he was.

NE has Sarah Fisher Elliott (1821-1872) married to Alanson and buried in Montezuma, IN 1872.  There is no FindaGrave entry for Sarah.  Possibly she is near the David Marion / Clara plot.

David (1854) named one of his sons Alanson.  My dad's uncle.

My Dad always said a-LAN-son and I figure he would know b/c his uncle.
Melanie says A-lan-son.
