David Elliott, the son of David Elliott and Mehitable Aldrich, born 1744 in Uxbridge Mass, married Deborah Elliot, daughter of John Elliot and Deborah Aldrich. This couple, David and Deborah were first cousins, and marriage between cousins was quite common in the 1700's. They and the majority of this Elliott family, along with David's parents moved to New York settling on the Beekman Patent in Dutchess County in the Pawling area around 1760 after the Native American uprisings were more settled. They traveled from Massachusetts through Connecticut by wagon. When they arrived in Pawling David, David's father leased a farm near his cousins and brothers farms. David met and married Deborah Elliot in Pawling about 1770. According to Beekman Patent papers David wife Deborah and son Peter leased a farm, later moving to his fathers leased property about 1775. All civil records of Pawling were destroyed by fire for the 1775-1786 time period. The First Baptist Church of Wingdale, where the family attended did not keep birth, marriage or death records. David and Deborah's children can only be speculated on, through various sources we are certain of Peter, David and William Elliott. David was an ensign in the Revolutionary War for the Pawling Militia. He retired from the Militia in 1786 as a Captain. He then moved his family to the Kingsbury area of New York to join his father and mother who had moved there. A tax list from Harper's Field lists a David Elliott for the year of 1788. So he remained in Pawling until after 1788. David is found on the Kingsbury census for 1790. He died August 3, 1793 and is buried in the Kingsbury Cemetery. His wife Deborah Elliott, was given the land bounty rights for her deceased husband, 500 acres in Cayuga County. She and her children David and Peter were in the Cayuga County area by 1810 according to census records. David and Peter are written about in Cayuga County history as clearing land in and around Scipio town. Deborah is next found on the 1830 census with her son David and family. Listed as a female between 80 and 90 years of age. She died Janaury 3rd 1838 and is buried in Segar Cemetery,  Steuben County NY. Her listing states her age at 88 years 4 months 26 days.
