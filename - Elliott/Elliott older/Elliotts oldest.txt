There is a bunch of documentation for

Daniel (1662) Sudbury and Sutton, MA
Daniel (1687) Salem, Essex and Framingham, MA
David  (1716) Sutton, Worcester
David  (1744) Uxbridge

There is some stuff about 
Daniel (c.1640) born in Ireland or Scotland

Three Daniels followed by a number of Davids.

Some information comes from what was an ancestry.com link (I have a printout)

which mentions "The Unproven Theory of Daniel Elliott"

thanks Richard and Linda Elliott being involved in the genealogy reconstruction.

There are many Elliotts who came to America before 1650.  See "Genealogy of the Elliott Family".

It is believed that Daniel (1640) was captured at the Battle of Dunbar (1651) or the Battle  of Worcester.

He was later transported to New England.  He shows up about 1661 in records from Salem.  The ships that carried Scottish prisoners were the "John  and Sarah", "The Unity" and "The Liberty".  There are partial lists of passengers but no match for Daniel Elliott. 

"A  Daniel Elliott was killed in Casco Bay Maine, by Indians in 1690 along with George  Ingersoll and some other men."

There is an alternative history 

http://www.ournorthernroots.com/getperson.php?personID=I16019

in which the first Daniel is from Devon, England and born about 1630.  He married Dorcas Pope in Devon 1659, and shows up in the Marlborough, MA area 1661. 

There is mention that Daniel Elliot (of Salem, 1662) removed to the "Pope" farm.

Daniel Elliott (1662)
"Daniel and family lived in and around Salem Mass, including Danvers, Sutton, Oxford etc. Daniel testified at the Salem Witch trials.

Daniel (1662)'s wife was Hannah Cloyce.  

He is quoted as giving testimony to the fact that the  girls were lying about seeing witches, making a remark in front of Daniel that "they  must have some sport."  He was a witness for Sarah Towne Bridges Cloyes,  step-mother-in-law (2nd wife of Peter Cloyes).

For example:

https://upperlevelgen.blogspot.com/2010/01/daniel-elliot-1662-hannah-cloyes-1677.html

Together with father-in-law Peter Cloyce Daniel and family moved from Salem to Framingham to escape the trials.

"In the testimony of Daniel Elliot at the Salem Witch trials, he was at the place of Nathaniel Ingersoll who was a relative of the George Ingersoll who was killed by Indians."  So that would tie Daniel (1662) to the elder Daniel killed by Indians.

"He died sometime around 1728 as that is the last mention of him in any town records."

There are still more possibilities for Daniel(1662)'s family.

There are at least two more Elliott families in the neighborhood.  The last link thinks he may be connected to Andrew Elliott, who is a neighbor of William Rayment mentioned as present at the witch trial testimony.

This must be another prominent Eliot family in America, descended from Andrew Eliot (Mar 14 1683 - Jan 07 1748) who lived in Beverly, Essex Co., MA.  His father was William B. Eliot (1655-1721).  If so, Daniel (1662) would be his brother or cousin.  I know of no evidence for this.

There is a a group of people that matched in DNA testing who thought themselves related to Daniel of the witch trials.  That'd be a Y-chromosome match, I guess.

Daniel Elliott (1687)
"his son Daniel and wife Sarah are still living in Framingham, and can be traced through town histories as well as tax, land and probate records. He died about 1737 but no record of burial still exists. Daniel and Sarah had six known children, one of which was"

His wife was Sarah Provender (married Feb 03 1708, 1707 old style) w/children:  Hannah, Mary, Benjamin, David, John, Lydia

----

David Elliott (1716)
"David Elliott, born in Uxbridge, found in Beekman Patent papers, removing to Dutchess County New York once the Indian wars had decreased. Fought in the Rev war. Married Mehitable Aldrich and had 9 known children, one of which was David".

His wife was Mehitable Aldrich (married Dec 20, 1739) and children Sarah, Daniel and David  Elliott (1744).  They called David (1744) "Ensign".  Ensigns would be infantry and the lowest commissioned rank.  More about him later in part 2.

David (1716) seems old to be fighting in 1776, so I would guess it might be David (1744) "Ensign".

suggests
IDAHO: Bob Elliott and Melanie Hollett

I found phone number(s) online.  208-265-4298
Talked to her briefly.  Lives in Idaho.  Her name is Elliott and his is Hollett.

She was going to send me an email invite so I can see her ancestry.com stuff, but it never happened, perhaps becasue she was kind of feisty in our short conversation.  She indicated that "we disproved that" about the legend of Daniel Elliott the Indian fighter being our ancestor.
