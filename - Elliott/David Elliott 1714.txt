Moved to Dutchess Co., NY about 1758 or 1759.  Went to Kingsbury after the war.  So the story below seems unlikely:

> A history of Dutchess County claimed that some of Washington's troops (no doubt very hungry) descended on some of the local farms around Dover/Pawling. One of the farms belonged to one of our Elliot families. The soldiers killed he livestock, chickens, etc. and basically "wasted" the farm. Shortly after this incident two Elliot families -- that of David and his brother John moved their household to Kingsbury, Washington County.
